## Code Validation

### HTML Validation
I have used the recommended [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files. Below are the results for each HTML page:

| `app.py` | [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauren21717/flavor-hub/main/app.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/python-validate.png) | No issues |
## Browser Compatibility

| Browser Tested | Intended Appearance | Intended Responsiveness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | Good  | Good |
| Firefox | Good | Good |
| Safari  | Good | Good |

## Compatibility Testing

To ensure that the website is functional and visually consistent across various platforms, the site was tested on different devices (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones) and operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, Android).

- **Results**: The Home page displays correctly on desktops, laptops, and tablets. However, on smartphones, buttons on the Login, Register, and Contact pages were not centered on small screens.

### Page Alignment Issues and Fixes

## Defensive Programming

To ensure Flavor Hub's security, stability, and user-friendliness, several defensive programming techniques have been implemented:

1. Input Validation:
   - All user inputs are validated on both the client and server sides to prevent submission of malformed data.
   - Example: Recipe ingredients and steps are checked for minimum and maximum lengths to ensure proper content.

2. Authentication and Authorization:
   - User authentication is required to access specific features, such as adding or editing recipes.
   - Users are restricted to editing or deleting only their own recipes, ensuring data integrity and security.

3. Error Handling:
   - `Try-except` blocks are utilized to gracefully handle potential errors, preventing application crashes.
   - Custom error pages (404, 403, 500) provide clear and user-friendly messages to guide users when something goes wrong.

4. Confirmation:
   - Before any recipe deletion, a confirmation modal is displayed to the user to prevent accidental deletions.

5. Search Functionality:
   - The search bar does not accept empty input submissions.
   - Form validation prevents submission without input, and an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.

6. User Authentication Redirects:
   - Users attempting to access the dashboard without logging in are automatically redirected to an error page, maintaining the security of user data.


## Bugs

- **When adding a new recipe, the steps after step one wonâ€™t be inserted into the database.**

    - To address this issue, I double-checked my `script.js` and found a typo in the `name` attribute of the stepTextarea.

        From:

        ```javascript
        name: 'preparation_steps',
        ```

        To:

        ```javascript
        let stepTextarea = $('<textarea>', {
            id: 'step_' + stepCount,
            name: 'preparation_step',
            class: 'materialize-textarea',
            minlength: '5',
            maxlength: '200',
            required: true
        });
        ```

- **Time input field can be negative**  
  ![Time input field error](documentation/bugs/time-nav.png)
    - To fix this bug, I set `min="1"` on both `add_recipe.html` and `edit_recipe.html`, preventing negative numbers in the input field.
    ![Time input field error fixed](documentation/bugs/time-nav-fixed.png)

- **Ingredients inputs overlap with the label**  
  ![Ingredients input field](documentation/bugs/ing_label.png)
    - To fix this bug, I refactored the `input:text` to `textarea`.
    ![Ingredients input field fixed](documentation/bugs/ing_label_fixed.png)

- **Adding more ingredients input fields doesnâ€™t allow typing sometimes**  
  ![Ingredients additional input field](documentation/bugs/ing-int.png)
    - To fix this bug, I refactored the `input:text` to `textarea`.
    ![Ingredients additional input field fixed](documentation/bugs/ing-int-fixed.png)

- **Unable to type "Thai" in the cuisine input field**  
  ![Cuisine](documentation/bugs/cusine_min.png)
    - To fix this issue, I adjusted the `minlength` attribute from 5 to 3 in both `add_recipe.html` and `edit_recipe.html`.

    From:

    ```html
    <input id="cuisine" name="cuisine" minlength="5" maxlength="50" type="text" class="validate" placeholder="Optional">
    ```

    To:

    ```html
    <input id="cuisine" name="cuisine" minlength="3" maxlength="50" type="text" class="validate" placeholder="Optional">
    ```

    ![Cuisine fixed](documentation/bugs/cusine_min_fixed.png)

- **In `admin_dashboard`, the edit category function is not working**

    - I discovered the issue was due to the `url_for` in `edit_category.html`'s cancel button.
    - To fix the bug, I changed `{{ url_for('get_categories') }}` to `{{ url_for('admin_dashboard') }}`.

    From:  
    ![Edit category](documentation/bugs/editcat-bug.png)  
    To:  
    ![Edit category fixed](documentation/bugs/editcat-bug-fixed.png)
