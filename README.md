## Design
- ### Typography
    - Google Fonts was used to import the fonts selected for this website. Imprima was chosen as the primary font for the entire site due to its clean and modern appearance, which ensures readability across all devices. Arimo was selected for the headings (h1-h6) to provide a distinct and professional look, adding emphasis and structure to the content. In case these fonts are not supported by the browser, a fallback to a generic sans-serif font was included to maintain consistency and readability.

- ### Colour Scheme
    I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/092b4a-0d3b66-fafafa-faf9f4-faf0ca-f4d35e-ee964b-ee7c1b-f95738) to generate the color palette for the website. Orange, blue, and their corresponding hues were selected for their association with energy and harmony, making them ideal for a website dedicated to recipes. These colors enhance the visual appeal and create a welcoming environment for users.

## Database Design
  - ### Database Choice and Structure
    - **Flavor Hub** utilizes MongoDB, a non-relational database, for its flexibility and document-based data model. This structure is ideal for handling the varying attributes of recipes without requiring changes to the overall schema.
    - This flexible schema is advantageous as it allows for a variety of attributes to be stored, even as the data evolves over time.

  - ### Current Collections
     The database, named flavor_hub, currently contains the following collections:
      1. **users:** Stores user information and credentials.
      2. **recipes:** Contains detailed information about each recipe, such as ingredients, steps, and associated user ID.
      3. **categories:** Stores different categories under which recipes can be classified (e.g. Desserts, Main Course).

  - ### Future Database Collections
     In future iterations of Flavor Hub, we plan to introduce additional collections to enhance user interaction and personalization:
      1. **comments:** This collection will store user comments and ratings on recipes. It will be linked to both the `users` and `recipes` collections to manage feedback effectively.
      2. **favorites:** This collection will allow users to save their favorite recipes. It will link users to their selected recipes, providing a personalized experience.
  
    These future collections will be added to expand the functionality of Flavor Hub and enhance user engagement.
  
  - #### Database Schema Diagram
    I used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) to create the database schema diagram. This diagram visually represents the current collections, their relationships, and the fields within each collection.

> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found on [Heroku](https://flavor-hub-c7318789b1c4.herokuapp.com/).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the non-relational database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.

- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a Platform as a Service (PaaS), for cloud deployment. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Create a New Heroku App:**
   - Log in to your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com).
   - Click "New" in the top-right corner and select "Create new app".
   - Enter a unique app name and choose a region (EU or USA), then click "Create App".

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app.
   - Click "Reveal Config Vars" and set the following environment variables:

     | Key                        | Value                   |
     |----------------------------|-------------------------|
     | `IP`                        | `0.0.0.0`               |
     | `PORT`                      | `5000`                  |
     | `SECRET_KEY`                | Your own value          |
     | `MONGO_URI`                 | Your MongoDB connection string |
     | `MONGO_DBNAME`              | Your MongoDB database name |
     | `EMAIL_API`                 | Your EmailJS public key |

3. **Prepare Deployment Files:**
   - Ensure the following files are in the root directory of your project:

     - **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all required Python packages.
       ```bash
       pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
       ```

     - **`Procfile`**: Specifies the commands to run your application.
       ```bash
       echo web: python app.py > Procfile
       ```
       Replace `app.py` with the name of your primary Flask application file.

     - **`runtime.txt`**: Specifies the Python version.
       ```bash
       python-3.9.18
       ```

4. **Deploy Your Application:**
   - Log in to Heroku CLI:
     ```bash
     heroku login -i
     ```

   - Set the remote for Heroku:
     ```bash

     ```
     Replace `app_name` with your Heroku app name.

   - Push your code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

   - Open your application in a browser:
     ```bash
     heroku open
